Client-Server commands

Commands are built in block
<block1>:<block2>:<block3>

<block1> - contains the player Id
<block2> - contains the clients command
<block3+> - contains additional complex arguements/information it is a list i will stay in a block a complex object might use multiple blocks instead

Each block is then broken into arguement pieces
<block2> = arg1.arg2.arg3

arg1 is reservered for the main arguement type connected, lobby, game
arg2 is reservered for what the the main arguement is doingA
arg3 is reservered for an actual dynamic arguement type for the sub arguement


Client commands the server currently accepts:

lobby.new:<lobby name string>   ## This creates a new lobby with the name <lobby name string> and puts you in it
   returns: confirmation
lobby.join.<lobby name string>  ## This places the client in a pre existing lobby with the name <lovvy name string>
   returns: confirmation
lobby.lobbies                   ## This returns a the current lobbies and number of players in blocks <block 3+> as lobNm.plyrNum
   returns: lobby name and occpancy
lobby.players                   ## This returns a the players in the clients current lobby <block3> as plyrNm1.plyrNm2.plyrNm3
   returns: player names



quit                            ## This will break the server loop removing the client from a lobby if in one and terminating their connection
